Branching model
---------------
Similar to [this] (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) branching model but with only **master**, 
**develop** and **feature branches**.

Develop main functionality in **develop** branch.

For new experimental features create separate branch.

Merge to **develop** from feature branch when you complete it.

Merge to **master** from **develop** branch on release and tag it with version number.
